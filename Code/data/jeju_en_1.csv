0,They only catered korean passengers and ingnored me the whole time. I asked a couple questions and just shrugged at me. Very impolite. Will never recommend this airlines at all
1,"They didn't let me check in on Friday and turned me down saying I need a Korean passport to do so. They wouldn't explain anything, had to wait until Monday to be able to call their English helpline, an agent told me that they switched their commercial flights and all existing bookings to special flights, with no cancellations or notifications to their non-Korean customers.

Very unprofessional, life-changing to the worst. If they were decent enough to send me an update, I would have booked my essential flight with someone else or used Japan for transit."
2,"Wouldn't let me on the plane and refused to issue me a ticket at the gate because I didn't check-in at the counter OUTSIDE of the airport when I was having a transit. I flew from Toronto and was having a 5hrs transit in Seoul to go to Hanoi. I didn't have a visa to even enter the country, how could I go through custom to get my tickets and go through security again???? Staff was super rude when trying to talk to me, felt like she was talking down on me."
3,"Do not fly this airlines unless you from korea. I flew from seoul gimpo to busan and the staff in check in counter refuse to give me receipt/tag checked baggage and asked me wait for 5 mins(i understand that this is cumpulsory for xray baggage). What make me feel racist and feel offended was, all the korean passengers have checked baggage and they believed them and just gave them the receipt tag without hesitation. Just because im not holding korean passport(im singaporean) and they dont believe me. Racist!"
4,"Don't trust, no service, don't operate like western airlines extra sneaky restrictions designed to steal your money"
5,"Horrible air line!

My wife and I were extremely disappointed with the service at Hahn Air Systems (JEJUair), beginning with they are not listed on the ramp so our taxi driver couldn't find it.
They limited the suitcases to 1 per person with a maximum weight of 15 kg, and for an extra bag which weighted exactly 15 kg the charged us the outrage amount of $195.00 US dollars. In top of this they make us buy a return ticket more expensive than the one we bought from you, $309.00 US dollars, claiming that immigration in Taiwan will ask for it, and they never did as I told them they wouldn't since I had lived in Taiwan and showed them my expired Taiwanese residence.

In addition, the girl at the counter provide and awful service, unprofessional, we believe she should not be working facing the public as well as the supervisor they even laugh multiple time at our predicament.

After paying the $504 USD extra we finally did our check-in, then we were asked by the supervisor to sit and wait for 3-5 minutes for our luggage inspection. That wait took longer and suddenly, just 5 minutes before our gate closed, a young lady from Jejuair appears to rush us to the security entrance saying that we were late, even though we got to the airport 2 h and 30 min ahead of our departure time.
The stewardess were not welcoming and just gave us a half cup of water after we asked for it, on a three hours flight. A for entertainment, food or drink services, there were not offered at all. Jejuair is not a recommended airline to be taken by anyone.

To put the ice on the cake it is imposible to find a email address where to claim refund for a ticket or a costumer service.

Sincerely,

Victor Garrido, MD"
6,"Terrible!!!!!!!!! Economy or not, they are below standards of even other ""budget"" airlines worldwide.
First, I flew from Korea to Japan. That's an *international flight*, which usually has a limit of 23kg for luggage. Not Jeju, they put it at 15kg. (For my fellow American travelers, imagine if Southwest changed their limit from 50lbs to 30lbs. Bogus.) What the f#@$ ?! That's even lower than the 20kg that other domestic flights in Asia set it at (for example, in China, Japan). So how is the price so cheap? They screw you on your luggage. Just to give you context, I'm on a three-week business trip in the middle of winter. That means sweaters, jackets, bulky clothes. A large, long-term-trip suitcase is standard to fit 23kg/50lbs. This is my first warning for foreigners who are taking long trips!
Second, there was absolutely no way to check in online or even with the app. I was ok when I got to Incheon airport at the kiosk, but I was one of the lucky ones. I saw another group of foreigners who couldn't even use the kiosk. The Jeju website and app are absolute crap for this.
Third, they made up bogus rules to not let me bring an already paid for coffee on board. ""No hot drinks allowed."" Sorry, but that's bull. **No airline ever has *ever* told me that.** Moreover, there's no law or regulation that states this, or else ALL airlines would be telling us this! (My flight experience is including in the US, Europe, and Asia.) So I had to chug down my hot coffee before I boarded the flight.
Fourth, all they give you is water. This is how I decided to title my review. It is just like Spirit airlines in the US, and that's just sad.
Fifth, they were too inept to check my luggage all the way to my final destination (my next legs of the trip switched to Japan airlines). So I had to get my luggage and check in all over again, go through security again, etc. Good thing I had a long enough layover in Osaka. Again, keep in mind I'm a seasoned traveler and I've had to fly multiple airlines for work before, none of which, were too incompetent to check luggage all the way through.
If you're hard up on cash, by all means, fly this crap airline, but you're probably going to pay the same fare as a regular airline if you want to bring regular luggage and eat/drink anything besides water on board.
Also keep in mind I didn't choose this airline. It was booked by work. On the plus side, now I know to avoid it at all costs."
7,"Took Jeju Air from Cebu on Oct 31st and return flight was Nov 3rd. Flight was full. It was a 4+ hours flight. Nary a small snack or water offered.
Would have been okay but it was too warm inside the cabin and really uncomfortable, wished they put on the air condition or cooling system. Other passengers also commented on this.
I understand it is an economy airline but at least they make their passengers comfortable too."
8,"Freaking online check in is a mess. I never thought an airline carrier would have such a bad website or experience. No reaction in many pages, translated only in parts, and very confusing navigation.

If the product/IT team is reading this, you have a lot of work to do.
The UX is awful and super confusing. It really shouldn't be, please get your website fixed, it is shameful in this digital age to have such an awful check in experience."
9,"I registered as member with its App, it disallowed me to input more than 1 word under “Given Name” and there is no place to input my middle names. Tried to buy ticket, no place for middle names. Asked the one-on-one chat with its web-site, the staff said middle names are not needed and can still fly with my first and last names as passenger. So I bought and issued the ticket with only my first and last name. At the airport, I was not allowed to fly without my middle names on the ticket because my first and middle names are together under “given names” on my passport. The staff said “Middle names” means there is a separate field on the passport that says “middle names”. If all under “given names” then all those names must be on the ticket as the passenger’s name. I ended up having to buy another ticket. Tried to refund the original ticket, I had to pay cancellation fee. Tried to file my complaint with the airline, it is like talking to my hand."
10,"When I get off the airplane,
I saw that anyone let someone go first even a mom has a baby. Just going their way, do whatever they want.
There were like an animal gate...
Costomer base is worst.. Seats are too narrow..cabin crew makes me rushing to put my baggage in the cabinet but we can't do it fast because the space is narrow.Even I sit in the first row, a cabin crew put my baggage in the cabinet of 7rows had a too hard time to pick our baggage.
Annoying flight ever.

The price on the Airseoul is almost same compering with Jeju air but why the quality is totally different...
I strongly recommend you to don't use this airplane."
11,"I booked this airline on skyscanner under the assumption that it had baggage allowance only to notice that it didn’t after the flight was booked. Not a problem because you can pre-book baggage allowance except their website doesn’t work properly and doesn’t allow you to do so

I called the customer service centre only to speak to a very unfriendly unhelpful staff

The day before my flight I went to the Chiang Mai airport to go to the check in counter there and ask to pre-purchase baggage allowance but they said they were not able to match the online price and the price to purchase is higher
Apparently I’m not the only customer with this problem but Jeju air has done nothing about it. Maybe it’s a scheme to get more money out of customers??"
12,"Bought tickets through English website and it changes to korean upon check out, wrong departure date entered,needed to change it and it took two days to get an English speaking agent on the phone, they also couldn't change it at the airport. Was told twice to call back because there was no one who spoke English. Although she spoke enough English to take down my name and phone number in English? They probably mess your departure dates up so they can charge you more. Horrible company.. I cancelled my return flight and flew Jinair."
13,"I missed my flight because of the worst service from Jeju airline..!!I arrived at jeju airline counter N(t2 Hong kong airport) at 1.50am to get ""only a boarding pass"" given I didnt had any baggage.. To shocked to see, not even a single person at checkin counter to issue boarding pass before 35mins from flight depature, thier boarding pass issuance machine was not working. It was last flight of the day, I guess the people at counter closed their shop early to get a nice sleep. Bought a ticket of low cost Jeju airline at business class fare, at the end got a low cost service.."
14,"Was taking connected flight from Busan to Vladivostok with overnight transfer in Osaka, company representatives in Gimhae refused me in check-in and boarding due to already used transit visa despite of possibility to issue a shore-pass or either stay in airport. No refunds, no ticket change - simply ""no"" and that's all.

Thanks, no more flights with your company ever."
15,"Don't download the app, it is utterly useless. We tried to do the check in and after 2h we gave up. Since we had to fly first flight in the morning we decided to go to the airport to make sure there was no problem and someone could do the check in for us. When we got to the information desk the lady did not believe we were unable to do the check in on the app. After 30 mins of her trying to do it herself she gave us some stupid reasons about why we couldn't do the check in online. 1h later she tell us to go home and come the day after to do the check in a couple of hours before our flight... WASTE OF TIME, USELESS APP AND USELESS COMPANY"
16,"Staff in the ticketing dest is very rude
Drinking ice coffee while she is explaining about ticket and if you don’t understand, she will shows you her ugly face expression
Never expect kind explanation
That why it is cheap
Poor service with bad attitude"
17,"Traffic to the airport was bad anyway so was delayed getting to the airport but still had 2 hours to spare before my flight left. I went to check in but the self check in machines wouldn't work. Queued up for a desk, then when I got there, the check in desk staff kept asking me loads of very unsual questions and wouldn't accept my HK visa. They kept asking why I was going to Cambodia (which I wasn't so was very confused) and then kept telling me I didn't have permission to go to HK. I kept reminding her that regardless of my student visa, I can visit HK without one as I am british, which she wouldn't accept. The check in lady then kept leaving to ask her manager questions and in the end I went to the manager and asked what the problem was, which it was then established there wasn't one.

All the messing around wasted so much time that I got through security and immigration just as my flight was on final call so had to full on sprint to make my flight. Very disappointed in the service. I wanted some duty free shopping but in the end all I got was a stitch."
18,"The self check in kiosks don’t work for Non Korean passports. The check in process was delayed because they weren’t there on time. I get this is a discount airline but I’ve had better service on other airlines.

When I told the attendant that I was gonna carry on my luggage, she insisted that I HAD to check it because it was 2kgs over. When I took out my laptop it was 10. She then proceeds to tell me to pay the baggage fee (which was basically the same cost as the flight) in CASH bc it’s more convenient for her. I then had to carry my laptop by itself throughout the airport to get to my flight while I see others with LARGER and heavier looking bags board the flight. I cannot in good conscience recommend this airline to those who don’t have a Korean passport."
19,Check in staff don't know the international rules and refuse the passengers to check in because of bad mood. Very unfriendly staff to communicate with. You can loose you money because of poor knowledge of the staff.
20,Jeju air is a scam. Their website is very misleading and their customer support is not helpful. I have never had a worst experience than this! I will never recommend Jeju air to anyone!
21,"My family and I recently flew Jeju Air from Seoul to Osaka on Tuesday May 7. I was incredibly disappointed in the customer serivce that was provided to us at the check-in counter. We were five adults traveling from the United States, with five check-in luggages. After she weighed all our suitcases, she said that we were 6 kg total overweight. By then, she had already put all our luggages on the conveyor belt, and they all had left the counter, then asked us to pay 60,000 krw. NONE of us even had any carry-on baggages, and could have easily taken out our duffle bags to carry 1 measly kg each.

We had no choice but to pay the fee, when she had multiple ways to handle the situation. When we boarded the plane, I saw everyone with 2-3 carry-ons each all stuffed together to look like 2. I was incredibly upset by the unfairness of our treatment. I tried to contact the airline and they asked us for more details of our flight, then COMPLETELY IGNORED ME.

I also wanted to point out that the tray table on one of our aisle seats was broken, and would have caused serious trouble if the plane had any issues during take-off and landing. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THEM AGAIN UNLESS I WANTED A DEATH SENTENCE. Fly at your own risk... they are a ""budget"" airline for a reason.

Oh, other minor things, they didn't even offer us water, you had to ask for it. What a joke."
22,"Cabin attendants were so rude and impolite. They never helped customers having trouble, and told us to solve by ourselves. Also the customers were sometimes disgusting (maybe because this is cheap airline tho). I never had such uncomfortable and frustrated moment in any other airline. Even the price is the cheapest, I will never choose this airline in my life. I never recommend this airline. (Maybe this airline is for only solo traveler like backpacker or who doesn’t care any hospitality)"
23,"Flight was delayed by over ONE HOUR while all passengers were already seated in the plane. Pilot and cabin crew did absolutely nothing to update the passengers on any details of the long delay and left everyone waiting in the cramp seat aimlessly.

Very lousy service and crappy staff. There is one particular male staff at Seoul airport check-in Row M (M is for Jeju Air) by the name of Lee SangHeung or something similar (I didnt spell it out, there was no name tag on him.) He was extremely rude and treated me as though I am a criminal. He kept interrogating me as though I am committing a crime and refused to let me check-in. I am going to further pursue this with Jeju Air. Such horrible service."
24,"Flight 7C2904 on April 27. To start with, the 1:30am flight was delayed 1.5 hrs, we sat on the plane on the runway the whole time. The flight attendant went through right away with water, looked at me then turned away. The whole 6.5 hrs on this plane she completely ignored us and never once offered water, which she went through frequently with...even when I tried to flag her down Her name was Tayo, I’m probably not spelling that right. Cute girl but true example that beauty is only skin deep. Not at happy with this experience."
25,"I have never seen a company made for scam. I had a go-return ticket and these guys canceled my return ticked without informing me, and then told me to buy my own ticket for 200 euros, simply 3 words: WHAT THE FU.K!"
26,We were in a queue from Danang to Seoul on 29 April 2019 Flight 7C2904 when a group of Koreans also checking in jumped the queue in front of us. We told the airline that they jumped the queue and the Koreans accused us of jumping the queue. The airline took their word and told us to go back to the line. We told them to check the security camera. They called security on us but the security did not want to get involved. They assume we did not speak English and attempted to call over a translator when we told them clearly we can speak English. That airline employee went and clearly told their colleagues and when it was our turn to check in the airline made it difficult for us to check in. They claimed our luggage was oversized and over the limit. We told them it was not and to check it. They went to get a translator again and we told them we speak English and do not need a translator. We are Canadian citizens vising family from Da Nang. Do not stereotype people that take your flight and then go to discriminate and harass us for trying to do the right thing. Flight may have been cheap but your service does not have to be.
27,"Not just the condition of the airline, but the unprofessinalism of the staffs. It doesn't matter how cheap the price of the ticket. I will never use Jeju air."
28,"On my way back from Laos to Seoul, the staff couldn't understand what I said ""liquors inside"", and told me to take out the bottles (wrapped with newspapers so as not to be broken) from my check-in baggage. I insisted in vain that it shouldn't be carried on. They never listened to me. As a result, I had to return to the check-in counter from the upper level baggage inspection area twice only to find that my check-in baggage was already gone into the plane and took additional time to retrieve it in order to stuff the bottles in the baggage once again. Finally I was given the new plane ticket whose seat was much far from the entrance than the original one. What a treat!!! They said no apology nor showed remorse."
29,The english wesbite to add extra baggage does not work so you have to pay full time at the check in.
30,"I don’t pretend to understand the idiosyncrasies of their website, but they tried to tell me, 36 hours later, that it was my browser, I even set up an account, got their app as someone else advised. The thing is everything goes ok (eventually) then it won’t let you pay or check out. I will try to download some error messages"
31,Don't book a flight Jeju Air. I booked a flight from Jeju Island to Busan as a guest. I have gone back and forth on their Facebook page as well as email but haven't received any confirmation email or information regarding my booking though my credit card has been charged. They have zero information regarding my flight that I purchased. If you choose to book with this airline please sign up for an account or otherwise you will have a serious headache on your hands. In this day and age I'm super disappointed to have had to deal with this mess.
32,Their system change my. First name we gave a proof and they refuse to correct it! They oblige to cancel and book again with feesof cancellation despite we showthem with the print screen we did before validate! Very dishonnest!
33,"We booked for 4 persons, we encoded properly all names and it was a strange message on korean and when we receive the confirmation it was a mistake in my first name and it eas sure it was well encoded because we did a print screen to check before validation! Of course we contacted them and after fews day of explanation very difficult with the jetlag they refuse just to correct the first name! And want that we buy again a ticket! Very dishonnest! To avoid"
34,"Forget any customer support in advance of your flight. We wanted to reserve seats but airline will tell you to get the app to reserve the seat but the app doesn't work. Email inquiry will go unanswered. If you go to the airport service center to reserve a seat days in advance, they will you tell you to download the app which doesn't work or call customer support which also doesn't work. Good luck with getting a seat. Just don't waste your time trying to get much help from airline."
35,"We attended the midnight flight, the announcement is non stop on telling us the time to shop duty free, serving snack etc. All the passengers couldn't sleep, it is very terrible.
When I pick up my luggage, the top corner is crash. It should affect by the hard hit. I am unable to reach out to any customer service. I emailed to Seoul and it feedback after a few days. They advise need to let them see the luggage situation so I need to go to airport early prior to back to HK. Unfortunately, this case need to handle by HK so I need futher email to them after the taken the above action. It is so confused. Finally, airline will not bear any liability, I need to claim my personal insurance. I for sure will not attend this airline again."
36,"My friend and I, we had a redeye flight to Seoul and during that flight everyone was already sleepy. The air hostess just kept turning the lights on three times to just sell duty free products, which basically nobody bought because everyone was really sleepy. Asides from that the aisle seats compared to the middle and window seats are a bit narrow. And also my friend when she asked for a cup of water the air hostess was mad at her.

On our return flight, in the check in counter the lady that helped us was quite rude and unfriendly. She even made my friend sign a letter of consent saying that their airline would not be responsible of my friend’s fare if she gets deported back from HK. (We were like, we are waived from Visa to enter HK and we have never experience this in our whole life)

Lastly, they also sold duty free stuffs again three times on our way back to Hk. I would not recommend taking this airline, unless you do find their tickets to be cheap."
37,Have you ever been to a pool that smells so much of chlorine that your eyes and nose start burning? This airline specializes in that smell x10. I couldn't breathe well to Jeju and back. It happened on two flights.
38,"Never fly with these people ever
They only allowed 15kg baggage on a 4 hour flight.
Not a good enough service"
39,"If you think of traveling will be relaxing, think again! Specially when you are flying with jeju air. Me and my husband left the Philippines with just one luggage (19kls) for the two of us and had a small bag and carry on luggage and was allowed with no hassle. But when we were checking in Incheon going back to Cebu the staff abruptly said we cannot checkin one luggage for the two of us as it must be one for me and one for my husband. We approached the manager and said if they will allow us to checkin only one bag for the two of us within the allowable limit (15each on ticket) but since we only have one it will be 25kls in total. But she just robotically said it is not possible. We asked her why are we permitted to checkin only one for the two of us in the Philippines and she could not explain it. She just insisted it should be one for me and one for my husband. Our flight from Cebu to Incheon was delayed and announced just few minutes before boarding. And to add another disappointment the gate has changed on our flight from Incheon to Cebu without properly informing the passengers!! We are never flying jeju air again!!"
40,"I preordered for the flight (which is extra despite being a 5-hour flight). I then ordered a glass of red wine to have with my meal once I was on the flight, but I came at least 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Then they would only accept Korean cash or a credit card - I only had Thai cash and Korea banks cards. Luckily, I was sat next to a kind person who helped me out. When the wine came, it was served in a paper Capri-sun-esque not-quite-bottle which I was supposed to drink with a straw.
This is not to mention that it is virtually impossible for a foreigner to book the flight in the first place. One of their payment solutions is (and I kid you not) to had over ALL the login details for your online banking!

Going down the rating here, it looks like I'm just an angry customer but:
- Legroom (my legs were splayed to fit at all)
- Comfort (I had back pain for weeks after)
- No in-flight entertainment
- Custom service - attitudes were fine, but they weren't actually able to help.
- Value for money - they are cheap but was in pain for the holiday.
- cleanliness - spot on
- Mobile check-in said I'm too foreign...
- Food - poor quality and terrible experience."
41,"So this is a budget airline. Fine. But I've flown other budget airlines and I was actually able to contact customer service. Not with these people. As a new member I was supposed to get all sorts of coupons but NONE of them worked. Since their no-baggage fares suddenly were sold out, and I didn't have a bag to check, I tried social media and they simply didn't reply ever. I sent them a message through their website and it took them 2 DAYS to reply AND when they did reply, it wasn't a reply but just a COMPLETELY USELESS copy/paste text telling me how to use a coupon!!! It's infuriating.

I ended up booking with them anyway because they were still the cheapest, and I'm supposed to be able to change my ticket for a fee but guess what, their website gives me a message that it's not possible to change a ticket after you've flown the first leg!!! AND suddenly they have flights for half what I paid. That smells really scammy to me, especially as no-baggage flights are non-refundable, there's no way these tickets could simply have been cancelled. Very, very scammy looking."
42,"Aircraft delay notice too late, no gate change notice, no local connection at delay, no priority boarding by ground personnel, no notice of travel in the event of knee joint pain or airport disturbances being addressed."
43,"Jeju air's Internet reservation system is totally messed up. It just simply doesn't accept the debit cards, and even with the credit card, it shows the processing window. That's it. It's just a scam, trash which happens to have a couple of airplanes. NEVER EVER try reserving flights in JEJUAIR."
44,"인천에서 후쿠오카행 오후 4시 비행이였는데 계속해서 연착하더니 결국 다음날 아침으로 연착되었습니다. 날씨+시스템 문제로 연착한거는 알겠는데 타항공사들에 비해서 직원들이 정말 우왕좌왕이고 서로 하는 말이 다르고 일처리가 정말 unprofessional의 극치였습니다. 다른 항공사 아시아나는 밤에 손님들이 있을 호텔도 arrange해주었는데 제주항공은 한 사람 당 2만원 지급하는데 다였구요 ㅎㅎㅎ 리무진 왕복만 해도 3만원인데 2만원이라니... ㅎㅎㅎ 정말 어이가 없네요. 그러면서 따지니까 항공사마다 다르고 제주항공의 최선은 2만원이라고 하니 말그대로 거기서 항공사 수준이 나오네요. 해외 많이 다녔는데 국제 비행 연착은 대부분 날씨 때문이던데 같은 자연재해 연착도 이 정도 저질로 보상해주는 항공은 처음입니다. 같은 저가 항공 중국 동방항공도 이비스 호텔이라도 해줬지요.
보상 수준도 수준이고 공항에 있을 사람 떠날 사람 인솔하는 것도 정말 무슨 어버버 신입사원 수준이고.. ㅎㅎㅎ 옆에 아시아나는 직원들도 노련하고 셔틀이며 호텔 서비스 다 해주는데 다음부터는 정말 몇 푼 더내고 아시아나나 대한항공 타는게 훨씬 낫겠다 싶네요.
제주항공은 그냥 이름 밸류대로 딱 그냥 저가 국내 항공 용인것 같습니다. 국제선은 정말 비추입니다.

The worst airline that I’ve ever experienced in my life. It neither has the service nor the infrastructure to carry international flights. Their overall quality is very typical of or even worst among cheap airlines.
My flight got delayed overnight (delayed to the next day morning) and all they gave us was less than 20 USD per person, while Asiana airline, which also got delayed for the same reason, provided the shuttle and hotel services to the customers. The jeju airline agents were all very unprofessional, inexperienced. They even made customers confused and made them stay longer at the airport due to their unclear instructions. They should run national flights to Jeju only as their name states."
45,"my flight is 7C2003 on 19Dec2017. This is my first and last flight with this airlines. they are the worst airlines I've ever tried in my life. we bought 2 person tickets which it included 15 KG baggage for each person. but we bought extra another 15KG for OUR LUGGAGE, NOT ANOTHER BAGGAGE???? If your airlines got the rule of baggage if buying additional MUST Write clearly that must put separately in another Baggage. couldn't combine 30KG in one luggage.. how your customer will understand ur policy and PURPOSELY BRING another baggage just for the additional weight???? plz don't wasting our time and energy to unpack and pack everything again at the airport????? how ridiculous is it??? NOT EVERYONE WILL BRING EXTRA BAGGAGE IF U NOT TELLING US IN ADVANCE OK..

Later we were asking for help at the Duty manager counter. But the ""duty manager"" name Moon Seong Hye came out with an unfriendly attitude and said MUST separate ur luggage, this is rule and left... And nothing explained or calm your customers down when they needed your help...you are the leader and you are representing your company so plz solve your company problem with the positive result and don't make it extra uncomfortable and inconvenient for your customers..
I'm not sure she wrote the correct name to us or no. cos she didn't wear name tag on duty and confusing to show us her responsibility. this happened at 3:30pm on 19Dec2017 at counter F18 at Incheon International Seoul airport.
I believed your company could find out by your ways and fix the problem. I really need the explanation of your side. if your company still wants to keep the loyalty of your customers. some more this's not only for us, and for your image on the other customers aswell.
I'm looking for your response soon.
many thanks"
46,"My RIMOWA baggage was broken by their mistake, but they didn't care and apologize until we asked. What surprised me was they make us go to counter by ourselves to departure counter, even though we have just arrived from other country. The manager Mr.HONG SOK HO who is in charge of Narita airport,one of the biggest city in the world, was too but to care any passenger.I really can't believe his service attitude and service mind.How could he be a manager? He doesn't have basic manner and knowlge,and he didn't greet and named until we asked.And his language skill was terrible! We cannot communicate with him by Korean or Japanese either, even though native speaker talked to him. We asked any customer service center of headoffice, but they said they don't have like that. Is this correct regulation?? After all, we convey our information and go back to home and wait their call , but they never care anymore. That's why LCC is just LCC, cheap and poor company. Please love your company, love your passenger,and have a pride like KOREAN AIR or ASIANA AIRINES.
Jeju air announced in the cabin that they are one of the biggest airlines in KOREA, is this correspondence be proud of? Don't make me laugh!
The company should educate basic manner, basic skills, and the way of speaking including your mother tongue, KOREAN.You know how important honorific expression is especially in Asia.
What a scary company! I never recommend this airline."
47,"This was the absolute worst travel experience I've ever had with any airline. I'm from the US and was planning to go to BKK. I flew Delta with the intention of transferring to jeju to complete the trip to BKK. I paid for a ticket the day before and thought everything was fine until I landed in Korea. They tried calling me en route there (23hr flight couldn't answer) then sent me an email on the day I landed saying my ticket was cancelled due to technical issues. NOT MY PROBLEM WHEN I PAID. As I was boarding they denied me my initial flight, then said I had to pay another $500 in order to go. I had no choice because I had to meet my brother who had never been to BKK before and we had no communication whatsoever. I only had a certain amount of money budgeted to make BKK a great experience. I had to use that money to get to BKK. A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. They said they would give me a full refund but that money wouldn't show up in my account until a week later. Screwed up the plans my brother and I had for lodging in BKK. I love to give everybody the benefit of the doubt but long story short Jeju Airlines completely screwed me over because of their incompetence and ""technical"" issues. I wouldn't suggest anyone fly with this airline. My worst travel experience to date and I travel a lot."

As soon as we arrive i immediately asked the information on how to get our next boarding pass. We were told to get our boarding pass at the gate 15mins before boarding. Good thing me and my team arrived at the gate an hour before the boarding. The lady at the gate was shocked and annoyed when she knew that she needed to make 22 boarding passes for my team. All my questions were not answered instead this was always the answer: ""Please wait"". When we were lining up at the gate, one lady from Jeju Air were talking to us in Korean and expecting us to understand her. Service in the plane was ok this time. Would recommend to consider other airline before this. Hope they would improve."
49,"I flew round trip with Jeju for the first time and this was the *worst* airline I've ever been on (and I've flown on some bad ones). First of all, the leg room is worse than a small Romanian passenger van. The attendants barely speak English and even their Korglish leaves much to be desired. Often times announcements are made *only* in Japanese. In short, this airline makes Wizz or FlyBlue look like a luxury airline. The only good thing about this airline is their price, but if I were you, I'd use Peach Airlines instead & if they aren't available, just pay more & you'll be much happier."
