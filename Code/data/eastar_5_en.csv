The staff were helpful, polite, spoke good English, and efficient. I booked my tickets online which was also easy. The flight was exactly on time and pleasant. Thank you Eastar!"
1,"value for money for a low cost airlines. I don't think they have only check in service, that's why you have to perform the counter check in. You better come early to avoid the queue and possibility of missing your flight!

the only downside is they only provide 15kg baggage allowance (for international flight i think at least 20kg) and it'll cost you a fortune if you want to upgrade your allowance.

however, the check in counter staff are great!"
2,"Budget travel to Seoul from HK.
I have flown with a number of budget flights and I have always found the air attendants to be very draconian on allowing for any food, even chips on board.
Eastar Jet seemed to take a different approach, they turned a blind eye on CUSTOMERS having some small snacks. Wow. a budget airline that actually considers customers.
They even provided free water in the middle of the flight (I have been on other budget lines that have tole you, if you need water to need to buy a bottle of water)
So kudos to Eastar Jet for this approach.
All other aspects such as check in, leg room are almost the same as other budget travel airlines in the region, no real difference.
I did find Eastar Jet prices to be significantly cheaper than other budget airlines travelling to Korea, so I will not hesitate to use them again in future trips to Korea.

P.S. on the way back from Seoul, the airline check in staff saw we were a relatively large group with a couple of small children and graciously gave us priority channel access to airport security. A really nice gesture and touch."
3,"I needed a one-way ticket from Seoul to Hong Kong on less than 24 hours booking time and got a great value and very good service from Eastar Jet, a Korean LCC (low-cost carrier). They were not picky about carry-ons, offered me an isle seat without my having to ask, and had friendly service during the flight. All this for only about US$70!

The inflight entertainment was watching one lady nearby continually ask for water and other things like water and more from her seat as if she was in First Class!

All in all a very good experience on Eastar Jet!"
4,"Air Asia is good, Eastar Jet is better. No Service on a budget airline flight is normal. Eastar does care for the budget travelers.

Flights to and fro are very much on time even though there was delay at departure due to air traffic arrangements.

Check-in was efficient and helpful.

Price without luggage is absolutely great value. Love the Beer in the flight as well."
5,"We flew from Kota Kinabalu to Seoul return, 2 adult's & 2 children. Unfortunately I booked via Opodo rather than directly via Eastar Jet, this meant that I was unable to checkin online, pre book food or get seat allocations prior to checkin. However following a quick visit to the Eastar Jet office in Kota Kinabalu I was able to resolve the seat allocations, the member of staff with whom I spoke was very helpful and there were no additional charges even though I was prepared to pay a fee.
For a Budget Airline I was very impressed by Eastar Jet, I found the cost of the flights to be reasonable compared to other Asian Budget Airlines. 15Kg per person of luggage allowance and they combined the allowance for a family group so there was no additional charges for my 20Kg bag. The flights were on time in both directions and the cabin crew spoke English and were very helpful. The Aircraft was relatively new, clean and I found the seat pitch comfortable (I am 1.83m tall). It was worth getting an Emergency Exit seat on the return flight and I had the whole row to myself, although not necessary.
The Cabin Crew provide free water on the flight, all announcements were in Korean and English. Eastar Jet accept credit cards on board the flight, but only accept the following currencies: USD, KRW, JPY and CNY. I ordered a coffee but they had no cream or creamer so If you want a white coffee bring your own creamer (the only minor inconvenience I found with Eastar Jet).
Overall I can only say that for my wife, children and myself our experience with Eastar Jet was excellent, based on this I would recommend this airline."
6,"I had a rare experience in Eastar Jet airline 'cause all staffs were consists of male. It is not important to someone though, in my case different may be.
Anyway, the facility was good and was comfortable enough for stay during flight.
All staffs were friendly and they had a big smile to everyone."
7,Had the pleasure of using their HKG-ICN service which was the lowest available on the date. Their contracted agents at the check-in weren’t the best people I’ve dealt with but the manager was able to change the situation for me. Flight itself was uneventful but I thought their duty free and snacks were reasonably priced. Had frequent water service and it was good enough for me. Will definitely use them again next time.
8,"Very good price for ticket , good and clean plane , the flight attendant very polite and the plane take off on time , Thanks"
9,"Good value, easy check in, friendly fluent english speaking counter staff. Food on board is excellent quality and very tasty and hot."
10,"The services of the airlines is really really good from the moment we book the tickets online and one of the names is missed the letter, they call and mail to us to reconfirm. When the flight from Jeju back to Seoul was canceled due to schedule, their staff help us to come to other airlines to get tickets without any surcharge and fee. We were totally satisfied."
11,"As always, Jet Blue came through. The service was friendly and excellent for such a short flight. I was kept informed by texts of only changes in my flight. My flight was a few minutes late leaving, but was on time at arrival."
12,"I flew from Bangkok to Seoul on this carrier on a whim. As opposed to most low cost carriers, this one didn't charge a fuel surcharge. Boarding was a cattle call so I suggest getting in the queue early so you can have access to valuable overhead baggage space. I purchased a preassigned seat and meal which didn't cost too much more. Unless you plan on bringing food on board, definitely preorder a meal as they don't have any proper meals to order inflight."
