Anyway, after a short stay in Seoul, we got on the train to ICN and seriously underestimated how long it took to get to the airport from the city and arrived at the check-in counter about 20 minutes before our flight was supposed to depart – normally at any other airport in any other part of the world, this would have meant that we missed our flight. But upon arriving, sweating and short of breath from running to the check-in counter, they still let us check in!!! We were also upgraded to one of the seats in the front (without asking for it) of the plane and got personally escorted through security and walked to the gate by the kindest agent we have ever encountered.

When we arrived at the gate, we noticed that they were still boarding and there was a small line when we arrived. We got on the plane and the massive 777 we were on was pretty empty and noticed that we were 2 of the 3 people seated in the front of the plane. It felt like we were flying private and it was wonderful. Sooner than we knew it, we were taking off and it was a short but comfortable flight to Osaka.

While it was absolutely our fault that we were late (and we were very apologetic), we were incredibly impressed by their customer service and kindness. If I ever have the chance to fly Jin Air again, we absolutely will."
1,"Crew were extremely kind and attentive throughout. The safety/emergency instructions booklet were illustrated with humorous comics making you actually enjoy reading them!
Also, most budget airlines on a short flight offer nothing - sometimes you even pay for water. Jin Air will give you a small cup of tea if you ask for it~"
2,"JinAir is the best! We got very affordable tickets and in turn had low expectations. However they were great! We brought our bags on (2 bags each under 10kg) for free. Seated together for free. We even got food for free. Safe ride, great staff. Highly recommend!!"
3,"Hi use this for return flight for Shanghai-Jeju-Shanghai. My Jeju-Shanghai connection was cancelled. The staff at Jeju handled it very maturely. They were authentic and firm. They not offered any hotel or assistance, but very helpful booking hotel and negotiating as per specific need of customer. Next day morning - same staff was working after just 6 hour break for alternate flight. The staff really carry ownership above and beyond. Its budget airline but no-frill was not at all visible in their employees. Thank you for building my trust."
4,"We were surprised to receive free food and water which was a great surprise, the staff was friendly, check in easy, no issues with carry on baggages, flight had no delay. We would fly again and we recommend it"
5,"I had an awsoem experience travelling on this airline. The staff are friendly and courteous! The flight itself was a good one. There was some turbulence, however, the pilot handled it like a pro, for the most part the ride was a smooth one. the seats are extremely comfortable and there is enough leg room. I definitely will be taking this airline again."
6,"This is my first time to fly with this airlines, it's an economy flight but free luggage loaded free for 15 kg. and free meal for everyone that I didn't notice before. The package are cute and good taste. If I have to fly to Korea again, this airlines will be in my list^^"
7,There is no food on flight feel got cheated for domestic flight! But there is pretty korean air stewardess very polite and friendly much better than tway Stewardess! Feel excited to take flight back to Seoul to continue my trip
8,"Having made up to a dozen flights with Jin Air over the last 2-3 years, I suppose I have become somewhat of a 'frequent flyer' with the airline. Most of my previous flights with Jin Air have been relatively short hops of between 30-mins and 1-hour duration from South Korea to the Japanese mainland, but this longer 2-hour flight to the southernmost Ryukyu Islands was nonetheless equally satisfactory.
A number of airlines offer budget flights from Busan to Okinawa and my selection of Jin Air was based on a number of factors including price and convenience. Whilst they continue to meet or exceed my expectations, they will continue to be my 1st choice on those routes."
9,"Another lovely Asian airline, so the service was amazing as well as the food served. The crew was very kind and professional. Really enjoyed the flight. Also the check-in was smooth and simply perfect."
10,"We booked our flight to Jeju online with Jin Air after doing our research. Lots of budget airlines flying to and from Jeju everyday but Jin Air seemed to have the best deals then. Booking and checking in online was easy. However since we had two children we, had to check them in at the counter in Gimpo and Jeju Airport. The staff at the counter and onboard were pleasant and friendly. Only thing is that they are very slow in answering queries via emails.
However, they are a good airline to fly with."
11,"An economy airline with very high standards of its staff.
Check-in and on-board teams were pleasant, helpful, professional and efficient. They went out if their way to solve a connection problem and, were thoroughly pleasant to deal with.
If l have to find a negative... it would be the casual dress code for cabin crew. Difficult to discern them from passengers and, as safety is their prime role... they lost some impact.
Very impressed with JinAir. I highly recommend them. The Best budget carrier l have flown with."
12,"The attendants are smiley and helpful. Food is delicious, though we only had simple cold snacks. Great budget airline!"
13,"Outstanding Exceptional Service! I am a United Airlines lifetime Global Services member (highest level) and flew Jin Air from Seoul to Narita. While there was a modest delay in the departure and because my original connecting time was 1 hour at Narita Terminal 1, I informed the flight attendants. To make sure that I made my connecting flight, they arranged for me to sit in an empty front row middle seat and made room for my luggage, and helped me get my luggage ready when we landed. The courteous, resourcefulness, and solution oriented plan helped me make my tight connection without any problem. It was one of the best service that I have ever received. I have flown millions of miles with many different airlines including the top airlines in Asia and Europe. Thank you Jin Air for the superb service!"
14,"My first time to fly Jin Air for my trip from Seoul to Bangkok round trip. Reasonable fare and didn't have high expectations. Flight attendants were very hospitable and attentive to passenger needs. Cabin was clean and all that - not much different from other airlines. In-flight meals were obviously not as good, and didn't finish them... Maybe for Jin Air to re-think what to do with it. All in all, I liked Jin Air given it's reasonable pricing. Recommend for others to try it out."
15,"The stewardess is good in serving the customers food , beverages ... at the same time the pilot are excellent with their flying skills as we have a non interrupted nap within 4 hours plus flight . Definitely will travel again with the airline"
16,"Great value for money, good deal in Easter holiday which includes baggage, light meal and good services. although online check is not worked for me, i did finished check in in counter quickly especially in Seoul Airport. around 10 counters were opened. Staff are cheerful and helpful. its surprising to see their causal but energetic uniform. I would choose Jin Air again."
17,"Not much to expect from this flight, a short trip from Da Nang to Seoul before heading home to SFO. However, it started off nicely with welcomed greetings as you would expect but then I cut my finger pretty bad loading up our carry on bags. The flight attendant was quick to provide a bandage but also she came back with ointment and applied it herself along with wrapping the bandage. I guess I was surprised by this as I would have been used to just being handed the first aid back in the states.

However, the most surprising thing and what was very nice was the airlines understanding that my father and I were needing to connect to our flight back to SFO. Our connection time was a bit short so they informed us as we were about to land that someone would greet us outside the plane (literally outside the plane) and escort us to the Transfer Ticket station (Korean Air).

This ended up being a life safer as my father is 71 and uses a cane to walk around, Terminal 2 of Incheon is a very large and having the Jin Air escort likely saved us around 25-30 minutes of additional walking/waiting to gain bearings, etc.

Very happy with the customer service shown by this air line and it's staff."
18,"Jin Air had the no-frills experience I was looking for. No frills, but A-1 service, comfy seats, efficient boarding, and over-all superb flight experience. No need to pay for more if a budget airline can provide all that Jin Air provided for us.

The flight from Cebu leaves around 2am and lands at Incheon around 7am of same day so we saved on 1 hotel night. We also got our tickets on sale at less than US$200 per pax round trip so it was doubly enjoyable to experience a comfy flight at a very low price. The flight back as equally enjoyable and comfortable. Highly recommended!"
19,"I flew Jin Air for a short trip to Taiwan. The check in line was pretty long but moved quickly. I was surprised by the two free checked bags policy even regarding a two hour flight. Guess I’m just too used to being ripped off my American carriers. The staff were all extremely friendly and we got a nice little snack box on the flight. This is unheard of on any low cost carrier in the US. Overall, I was very happy with the experience."
20,"Although only a short (1-hour) hop between Osaka, Japan and Busan, South Korea, I found all aspects of the Jin Air flight to be commendable; efficient, courteous and helpful. I understand Jin Air is a subsidiary of Korean Air and it shows in that it provides the kind of service you would expect from a major carrier, at budget prices.
Having previously flown Jin Air on longer routes Busan - Okinawa and Busan - Guam, I have never been disappointed with any aspect of the airline and they would be my first choice on any route that they fly within Asia."
21,"Jin Air offers an excellent service which connects Kota Kinabalu to Incheon. The wide bodied Boeing 777 is ideal for this 5 hour flight with adequate leg room and comfort even in economy class. The ground staff at Kota Kinabalu and Incheon are very courteous and helpful. Overall, this is one low cost carrier which cares for passenger satisfaction and comfort and it stands above the rest. Recommended."
22,"The flight attendants do a great job, and I've had a pleasant flight every time I took this airline. The only time there was a problem was when a return flight got delayed for a few hours because the plane had been held back in Cebu due to a typhoon. I received a text message that morning that advised me about the new departure time, and got to spend a few extra hours in the city, instead of waiting in the airport."
