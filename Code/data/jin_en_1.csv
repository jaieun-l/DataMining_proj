0,"I want to open a complaint following what happened on Saturday 23 November 2019.
I booked two tickets for me and my partner to fly from Macau to Seoul Incheon and whilst I was entering my data, your system won’t allow me to insert my full name, due to the blank space between the two names. For this reason, I insert the first name without my middle name and completed the whole process.

But on the aforementioned date I went to the boarding check to drop my luggage and during the passport check, the operator told me that I won’t be able to embark the flight because of the name mismatch. And after that we went through a series of very unprofessional explanations about how your procedure work, that I had to cancel both mine and my partner ticket in order to book again the seats and how the price of a single ticket went up 6 to 7 timefolds and how to refund these tickets.

In the end because of your system’s fault, I had to purchase a new ticket with a different airline and fly separately from my partner, with all the distress caused by this situation, also because I’m pregnant.

This is one of the worst experience with an airline!"
1,"We attempted to book a flight from Naha Okinawa to Seoul; after entering all the data for the flight and each passenger the website basically crashed when I hit enter, after attempting it again and it failing, I gave up..

So I called the customer service/reservation desk, after about 45 minutes I had booked my tickets and had to pay an additional fee due to not using their website. I explained I tried using their website and would prefer a website vs calling international. But to no avail.

I was told they did not accept my reservations on line due to not having a Korean credit card? Later the second individual said that is not correct. So I have no idea why the online app did not work.

So we made hotel reservations and began planning our trip.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) I received an email stating the return flight has been changed from Tuesday to Thursday???

Wow, so I checked on line and the flights all showed ""SOLD OUT"" so I called and was told they canceled the flight because not enough people had booked seats.

I find this appalling, they sold us a product and should be obligated to provide it.

It is amazing that they would cancel several daily flights, and possibly leave people stranded in Seoul for two days.

I requested a refund and was given most of my money back. However they said they could not give back the ticketing fee for booking over the phone. Even though I did not want to book over the phone and had to due to their wanky website. So I ended up having to pay for ticketing that I canceled, along distance call as well as 1.5 hours between the two calls and website, and I got nothing.

So, I booked a new flight on Peach, did no need to change any hotel reservation and am happy so far.

I will never attempt to fly JinAir and would suggest avoiding it at all costs, if they can't run a website, reservation system or refund people's money, can they truly maintain aircraft?

AVOID"
2,Very cheap flight that doesn’t know how to treat passengers. Very rude and not friendly at all. The food is terrible too. Never will take this airline again.
3,I booked a flight a couple of days ago for around 8pm. All flight for this day where very similarly priced but I thought I would be spending some time in Seoul throughout the day. My plans changed and I arrived at airport at 1pm and asked them to move me onto earlier flight if they had availability. They informed me I would have to cancel my reservation and make s new reservation which is ridiculous. They had a half empty flight leaving within the hour and was not willing to move me forward with a charge that was the equivalent of 6 times more than the price of the flight 2 days ago!!! I discussed with the manager at the airline who tried to convince me this is normal and that all airlines do it but this is not true as I have flown with many airlines and had this happen in the past. It makes sense for the customer happiness and also for buisness sense as the flight that leaves in an hour will have empty seats which cannot be sold. They could then have 5-6 hours longer to sell my original seat!! Lack of customer service and buisness sense. I have used Jin air a couple of times and I will not use this flight operator again.
4,"Utterly rubbish, their website gave us so many problems and their call center is not very helpful either, steer clear.!"
5,"its for sure the worst service i have ever got in a flight. i was delyed during the check in with no reason i can tell about ( and the staff dont speak any english). after that i was taken to another room just to meet another staff member that asked me to take out things from my baggage and as well spoke only korean.
it is cheap indeed, but not enough fir this expirience."
6,"I k ow Jin Air is owned by Korean Air, but it’s a LOW cost carrier emphasis on low. The plane is fine for short flights and the crew are friendly and attentive, but the real issue is the check in counter. It was complete chaos, poor signage, no helpful staff and defiantly not non-korean friendly. First I lined up in what I thought was a jin air line, to find out it was for the wrong flight after 30 minutes. Then the area is small that lines merge with other airlines. There wasn’t a single staff person to offer help. It was intimidating and frustrating. My flight left at 1:45 am and being st the airport more than 3 hours early wasn’t enough. It too over two hours and fifty minutes to get through the check in process. Never again. I’ll spend hundreds of dollars more to never have to go trough that again. And to be honest the LCC price was way to high for the lack of service. Spend the money and use a major carrier."
7,Had a 5 hour delay due to weather supposedly but weather was fine at originating and destination location. Upon landing spent a half hour waiting for a gate and then nearly an hour waiting on luggage as it dropped in 10 at a time. Obviously they aren’t staffed to handle the travelers. I’m done with this airline.
