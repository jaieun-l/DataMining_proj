0,"EASTAR Cancels flight but customers cannot get FULL refund online . Why? To inconvenient passengers? Just automatically refund to customers asap, reputation looks bad for EASTAR. People are watching Airlines during this Virus crisis, who are the caring airlines and which are not"
1,"DO NOT BOOK IF YOU ARE A FOREIGNER. The company canceled our flight and instead of refunding our money they are making us jump through hoops to get our almost $800 back. They're telling us it is because I paid with a foreign credit card but they didn't have a problem taking the money, just giving it back."
2,"Im honestly not one to write a review but im standing here typing after waiting more then 5 hours between when i was scheduled to depart and being told i would be delayed. I went to the desk at 7am for check in to my 9:10am flight and was told it would be delayed to 1:20 due to bad weather. This was the only fing plane delayed, my girlfriends plane took off to Manila at 9:10 as scheduled.so i wait and ask if theres any compensation meal voucher or apology for the ridiculous sudden delay without notification, nothing. So 1:30 rolls around still on the ground and pissed off enougj at 2:00 to write this review. I get its a budget airline but f*** save your money and self some headache and time and buy elsewhere."
3,We wore flying close to 6h from Seoul to Bangkok and wore not informed that the airlines only accepts korean bank card or dollars for purchasing food on flight. A INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT (?!) nonsens! The staff was also rude and did not offer to help us in anyway at all. First and last time we fly with them.
4,"This airline has caused me so much grief!..I missed my flght because of the ineptness of the staff, poor communication based on the language barrier, rude staff at the check in desk sho tells you that you choose to book with a korean airline so its our responsibility to search for translation regarding the language. Based on a notification which I received I went to terminal 2 as thats the terminal I came in from and was told that i should go to terminal 1. This process took approximately half an hour. I got to the desk only to be told that I dont have visa for re-entering a country whcih I was coming from (Japan) with the re-entry slip which was stapled in passport and my residency card presented, this staff was teling me nonsense becuase they didnt want to let me onto the flight. This back and forth took a further 20 minutes, after which I was told the flight is closed. I suspect they might have sold my seats as there was adewuate time for them to process me. I was then told that I had to buy a new ticket to go home. There was no reasoning with them, they wouldn't budge. I had to buy a new ticket for me and my daughter on a different airline to go home while this airline had my money for my flight. Not only that! the flight itself coming into seoul was awful. The take off was very shaky and felt uncoordinated . I would not recommend anyone to take this airline! They are a very disingenous set."
5,"I have just had an awful ordeal on Easter, that went like this:
-Flying from HK to Seoul
-Get on the plane and it is incredibly hot (like 40 C), after 20 minutes there is an explanation that the air con is broken so we can't take off.
-We wait in extreme heat on the runway for 2 hours- no one is let off! It was sooo hot.
-It is then announced the flight is cancelled, but we are stuck in the plane for another 30 minutes before we can leave.
-Eventually we leave the plane and wait in a corridor- the airline explains they are transfering us to a different flight.
-At this point there is no real communication of what is happening, they walk us through the airport- children get separated from parents at one point- it all gets quite stressful.
-Then Korean passengers are allowed to board another flight, whereas international passengers are told to wait for 12 hours.
-People start getting angry that the airline has allowed Koreans on a flight 6 hours earlier when there were elderly passengers and children forced to wait.
-One manager given the task with dealing with the whole situation- he starts speaking English then pretends he can't- then the remaining passengers and him have a furious argument in Chinese- he has a hard task but was being racist and had totally lost his temper so no real sympathy.
-Still waiting in the airport now...

DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!"
6,"I used this airline and got really upset.
They charged for a stroller as my son is older than 28 months ( others don't).
The did not let me know that i had to go to a different gate because I am a foreigner. The air plane is old and uncomfortable. I would never use this airline again."
7,"#DONOTFLYZE #ZE551 Flight, CJU - BKK on 9 Jan 19 Time 21.30.
Purser crew had very bad behavior to the passenger.

I’ve travelled a lot, gone to many beautiful countries around the world, and South Korea is one of my most favorite destinations. Therefore, I decide to bring my family travel to Jeju with hope that we can have good moment together, everything seemed to be good untill the returning flight.

The flight was delayed, but it was still understandable. However, the worst thing is that we have your purser crew on that flight.

I don’t remember her name since it was written in Korean, but I do remember that there was a word “purser crew” on her name tag. She was the only one who was on the scene, and this is what happened that night.

My father went to lavatory, but the door was banged by her. After the door was opened, she strongly pulled my father arms, and blamed that he smoked in the lavatory. He refused, and continue to use the lavatory. However, she stared at my father rudely and smell his body to find smoking evidence after he came out. But she couldn't find anything. My father was very angry, not only because he was blamed for what he didn't do, but also there was no apologize for such a bad behavior. He returned to the seat, and told me averything that happened.

Later on, the purser crew stared at my father again, during the time that she perform a cabin patrol. So, I called her and asked what happened. I didn't remember the exact wordd, but she just speak without any respect that ""your father didn't anything, do you ask me for what?"", and leave. I went to galley to find her again so that I could get a clear explanation for what she's done, but she avoid to confront me. Another crew showed up instead, I told her that such a behavior is not polite, I explained to her that, in Thai culture, we usually show our respect to seniors, and we usually say sorry when we make mistake. I asked her to tell the purser crew to say sorry to my father, but she ignored.

I questioned to your airline's SOP regarding to how to deal with a suspect smoker on board. No matter what happen, your crew have no right to pull passenger’s body, unless that passenger was unruly, and the behavior could effect on inflight safety. Further, there was no burnt cigarette found, and the smoke detector was not alarmed.
And, I also questioned on how you get your cabin crews joined your airline, such a person with bad attitude and behavior should never be qualified enough represent your airline. What a shame!

I will never travel with EAST STAR JET again, and I'll tell everyone of my friends, colleauges, do not travel with ZE. Otherwise, they might get such a bad experience like mine."
8,"I had a connection flight with Eastar via Seoul. The airline officers refuse to check me in for the connection flight from Seoul and told me I will not have enough time at Incheon to connect because I will have to go through the border control. This was a lie as it turned out. They had me reschedule my travel, which did cost me a lot for cancellation and new tickets. The reason was simply that there flight was delaying and they did not want to be responsible for my missed connection. If you flight with this company you are at risk."
9,"Person on check in was completly rude, unprofessional and racist(agreed to check in only asians). She sent us to the differebt queue where we have to start waiting all over. Finally her manager seemed to be drunk or under something.... just dont fly with them - save your day."
10,"When I arrived at the airport, I was unable to find my flight on the check-in screen, but I was able to find their check-in queue, where a printed note informed me that my flight was cancelled. I had not previously been informed about the cancellation.

I went to the counter and mentioned that I was booked on the cancelled flight and asked them to move me to their next flight to Osaka, which they agreed to do. However I was left dumbfounded when they informed me that they would not do it for free, but rather they would refund my previous flight and I would have to pay full price for the fight next morning, which was about double what my previous ticket had cost me due to the last-minute booking, nevermind accommodation costs for the extra night.

I proceeded to search the airport for another airline to book with, but most of them were fully booked due to the cancelled Eastar flight, except for one which charged an exorbitant amount due to the last-minute nature of the situation. Eventually I had no other choice than to fly with Eastar the next morning, and I figured I would contact the airline later for compensation of the unjustified extra fee as well as the forced hotel accommodation.

However, when visting Eastar's website, it turns out they don't have any contact info on their website apart from a fax number. I guess they really do get a lot of justified complaints, because for an airline to hide contact info is beyond shady. Basically a scam airline although whenever they manage to actually get a plane in the air, they have competitive pricing."
11,"When we arrived at the airport we were informed that we need to pay extra money because our bags weighed 20 kg and not 15. We were rushed to pay and were told “pay the money or leave your bags here”. We obviously payed the money using a card and asked for a receipt. The lady in the counter wouldn’t to give us the receipt and asked us to move on so she could assist other travelers. We refused to move and demanded a receipt again and had to call the manager. We eventually got the receipt, with a rude attitude from the staff. The actual flight was ok.
Bottom line- would NOT recommend."
12,"My initial booking was fine but problem started happening when my free luggage included in air fare becomes chargeable item after i added meal avfews weeks before departure date. The airline checkin rep and supervisor wasted me over 1 hr and still unable to resolve but offer me a solution : if u pay, we for the luggage we can continue and finish the checkin process. Despite many sorries , now matter what , I have a flight to catch which leaves me NO option but to pay extra . Thus this was how I was treated by this airline for their own system error. Stay away if u come could , they are so smart in finding ways to get more more money regardless of their faults or not. I paid over usd$70 which means more than while dinner price !"
13,"We got delayed for both trips going to Danang and hoped the return would be smooth. We boarded an hour late and waited again in the plane. The seats are so uncomfortable you cannot sleep. My back and neck still hurt from that 4 hour flight, worse than a 10 hour long flight on a proper flight. Will never take this flight again."
14,"The aircraft is okay, average in general.
Service on board is okay too.
Service on the ground, however, is not. The queue is awfully long with not so fast of a service.
Take off, average.

LANDING. One of the most crucial parts. It is horrible and horrifying at the same time. It feels like the pilot has little experience as the tiny plane bounced and swerved, unstable.

I would not recommend anyone, that has a little extra budget, to choose this airline."
15,"I am writing a trip adviser review for the first time ever because I am so disgruntled with this airline. There were multiple things wrong with this airline. To be fair, the flight itself was fine. Everything that was wrong was the check-in/service. Below is the most ridiculous part of my experience with them:

They made us pay a RIDICULOUS name change fee because my parents had not put their middle initial when buying the ticket. They made up BS saying that my parents wouldn't be able to get through security since it is a law that the name has to match the name on their passports exactly. First of all, that is definitely not the case. My father whipped out multiple flight boarding passes from our trip into Korea that had only his first and last name. Second we went to Incheon airport's general counter afterwards and everyone there said that only a first and last name is needed. Third, maybe it would have been ok if the fee was just $5 or something. No. The fee was $40. Per name. Per flight. We had a round trip flight, so it was $160 total. Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous? My parents are Korean and speak the language fluently, so this wasn't a matter of miscommunication. We even tried speaking with their manager, who said there was nothing he could do.

I think in an effort to appease us they gave us seats all the way at the front (economy still). That made us even angrier considering right before they sprung the name change thing on us, they denied our request to sit in the front saying that they need to balance out the plane weight. I know that is a thing, but if they were going to give the seats to someone anyway later why deny us when we're asking first?

Also other very minor things were that the plane was delayed 1.5 hours and they provided water as ""free service"" as an apology. Again, I understand they are a low budget airline, but come on. There has to be something better than just water, which they gave us again later anyway during the flight.

I was so incensed at the time. This was about 3 weeks ago. I'm writing here also because there isn't even a proper place on their website to submit a complaint. It looks like I have to just directly call or become a member.

This is what we get for trying to save money. Which we didn't since we bought $300 tickets in advance and they dropped to $150 the week before the flight because no one was buying. They got us on that one. Actually, they got us on everything.

Eastar Jet: 5
My family: 0"
16,"Service staff was rude- they forgot to issue tickets, and they made you re-Queue just to collect them. Rather unpleasant experience especially when they can’t seem to understand English and wave you off or ignore you. Most of their customers are Koreans so maybe learning English isn’t a priority for other international guests. Perhaps being a budget airline they didn’t seem to bother very much. Give them a miss if you can."
