0,"I need to change my name but after calling them many times, they said cannot change name. They told me to cancel but actually cancel instruction is not provided and finally I cannot cancel my ticket to revoke my money. The worst service and booking system I have ever seen. Tway should be stopped from doing bussiness. Terrible inpression. Everyone should never touch Tway if you don't want to be regretted and disappointed, angried, tired of a Korean airline"
1,"T’way has very racist staff! It has happened twice at different airports. They don’t greet us because we are black and then require us to wait ten minutes while we are checking in our baggage. The white foreigners aren’t allowed to do that. Last flight I had with them one of the white passengers heard the conversation between the staff in Korean that only I was required. The clerk held my baggage form and said I would only get it back in ten minutes whereas the white passenger dropped her bags and walked off! It’s 2020 and it’s very sad that people are still judging others over their skin color which is something neither of us had a say in. The one staff at Jeju airport shouted at my friend and I to wait at the yellow line for five minutes and not to leave. No other passengers were told to do so, she literally stood up to shout in front of everybody and we waited over the specified time so my friend went to the guy in the work station near her and she then said it’s fine I turned around and told her we’ve been waiting and she had not said anything! Other airlines all require your number in case “something” is wrong with your bag but T’way acts like it is airport security requiring your ARC, asking us to take off our masks and so forth! It’s disgusting and I would not recommend any black travelers to make use of this airline because they make it seem like you aren’t even paying for decent respect!"
2,The low weight requirements doesn't make sense. The cost for the luggage cost me 6 times more than the flight ticket. No help with when the next flights were canceled due to too many passengers had changed their flights due to coronavirus. I was only supposed to be in Seoul for almost 7h transit. In Fukuoka they caused so much trouble that I almost missed my flight despite getting to the airport very early. It looks like I have to be stranded at the airport for at least 4 days. Not everything was their fault but it could have been less problematic (I'm supposed to fly to Vietnam which has been some restrictions from the Vietnamese government). They didn't even offer to help. Their weird luggage requirements made me lose almost half of my luggage. Their English level is very low which makes it very frustrating. They don't feel any responsibility when they mess up things for me. I caught different staff lying to me. This isn't over yet. I have experienced some bad things with some other airlines in the past but T'way is the worst airline I have ever experienced. No other airline I have experience with has been remotely this bad before. T'way should go out of business for the best interest of any potential customer. Stay away from T'way or strongly regret your choice.
3,"T'way Air suddenly cancelled all flights from CNX to ICN starting Feb 12 to March 28 - notice was given via email one day before, on Feb 11.

They've left customers stranded in Thailand with no other alternative flight that can get us back to Seoul on the same date - and they won't even refund money unless customers manually go to cancel their booking through their awfully-designed booking system. I'm still wrestling with the system and haven't gotten my money back.

This airline is a total scam."
4,Worst customer service people. Doesn’t have empathy to guest. Simply just business minded. Flight affected by the corona virus they wouldn’t even refund. They only care about money. Dont ever choose this airline!!!!!!! They don’t deserve even A star !!!!
5,"To be sure, I haven’t flown with every airline so there could be worse ones. This airline is so petty trying to save a penny here, steal a dime there and they are not up front about costs. Their website is completely uninformative. I’ve flown with them before and they skimp on safety and training as well. I’ve already written about how the pilot aborted the take off coming out of Bangkok, blowing three of the four undercarriage tires. And then they tried to cover up what really happened with a bogus story about air conditioning malfunction.
What really irks me however is how they try to offload costs onto the environment instead of following more respectful policies. Case in point: they insist on using new paper cups, filling them less than halfway, instead of using previous ones, even when passengers request it. Their “meals” — or rather horrors in a boil-in-bag — are mostly single use plastic. What food you do actually get is inedible. I’d suggest boycotting this airline if you value your personal safety and the environment."
6,"Cost of checked luggage was not up front when purchasing tickets other than “airline may charge baggage fee. Check with airline”. One would not expect a $50 charge per bag on international flight Vietnam Air, Eva Air China Air Japan Air. ... none charged for bag
I would choose a different carrier next time"
7,T'way website indicates 1st check bag up to 15kg is free. Even when we readjusted our suitcase down to 15kg the check in attendant still charged us 4500 yen. I'm disappointed I didn't have their policy available at the time.
8,"Dear Sirs

I wish to address with you my extreme dissatisfaction with your services in general, the lack of functionality of your website and the poor service at check-in that I have received today at Incheon International Airport.

Firstly, the poor experience I received when purchasing my first ticket. According to the ticket that was produced, my flight was due to leave on 12th of October, but the dates I selected on Skyscanner.net was very clearly the 19th of October. All my attempts to log-in to your website to try and deal with this were unsuccessful, as it kept returning ""email address not found"".

Despite this, I asked my girlfriend (a native Vietnamese speaker) to call your office in Ho Chi Minh City to try to help on my behalf. The agent was unable to find any details about the flight on her system (unbelievably) and she was told that I would simply have to purchase another flight.

This I did for this evening (TW121). Again, when trying to check the baggage allowance I would be permitted, my email address (or flight reference number, or any number/name combination that I tried) was still not found. So I resorted to trying to google, with the result that it clearly says:

Baggage allowance
The maximum weight allowed is 20kg for international flights and 15kg for domestic flights. For hand baggage, you are allowed one small carry-on bag with three sides less than 115cm and lighter than 10kg.

Upon arriving at the airport, I was told that there was no luggage allowance available on my ticket, and I would have to pay the extorsionate amount of 80,000 KRW, an amount I do not have available and I have had to borrow in order to get my luggage home.

The check-in staff were completely inflexible, and refused to do anything to help me, despite admitting that I had a very valid point about the lack of functionality and just suggested contacting Trip.com (whom I purchased the ticket through).
They also refused to refund my ticket when I told them I wished to find a different airline to fly with. Had there been a direct flight to Ho Chi Minh city leaving this evening I would have gone with them. I had removed my bag from the check in counter ready to go.

I shall be informing every single travel review site that I can find of the poor service I have received. I shall never fly with you again in my entire life, and I will strongly recommend that every other person I know to avoid you."
9,"Just bee horribly let down by t'way.
We had booked tickets in Feb 2019 to travel in Sep 2019, from Seoul to Sapporo. Received a curt email from t'way on 12th Aug informing us that the flights from 16 Sept to 28 Oct have all been cancelled.
Massive panic to make new bookings with another airline, you guessed it at far greater cost.
What is the point of making a booking if t'way is simply able to cancel it without giving any form of explanation, throwing your plans into chaos.
Made the booking way in advance while we had the time to do so. Just sent half a day (I did not have to spare) and 4 times more to rearrange our plans.
I advise you avoid t'way like the plague. Disgraceful. Held our money and our hopes for 6 months to simply dump on us by means of a terse email. No explanation or apology! If you actually want to travel, do not use t'way. Zero out of 10."
10,"Hands down worst airline I have ever flown on. Plane had problems, had to board another plane on the other side of the airport. Pathetic."
11,"I was flying from Vietnam to Korea on June 24, 2019. I had booked a ticket way back in March and was never informed that one free checked bag below a certain weight was not included (as is the norm on international flights). And since I was not informed that there was no baggage allowance, I did not know I needed to purchase the bag online ahead of time. Instead, I showed up at the airport and they charged me $80 to check my 18kg bag. When I asked whether the bag was overweight, they told me the weight didn't matter, the charge was for checking a bag, period.

Look, I know everyone hates baggage fees, but we all deal with it and it’s normally not that big of a deal. But, getting surprised charged half your ticket price for an underweight bag that the airline never told you that you would need to pay for flat out sucks. And, when I asked if I could buy the bag online, they told me it was too late because the check in counter was already open. I don’t normally complain about baggage fees, but this was ridiculous. My ticket cost $162 and then you surprise charge me another $80 at the airport where there’s nothing I can do but pay it, miss my flight, or go naked at my next destination. That sucks and it’s not fair.

$80 seems pretty excessive for a single checked bag, but I might have been willing to pay it if I knew it was coming and was able to fairly shop around. Instead, I got blindsided and screwed. And I want to make sure that doesn’t happen to anyone else.

Personally, I’ll never fly T’way Air again; but if choose you to, heads up, there’s likely to be a pretty heavy bag fee in your near future."
12,"Absolutely despicable with their baggage charges. There was no mention on my ticket confirmation that 0 baggage was included in the price until I was checking in at the counter 2 hours before my flight was to take off. Their argument was the baggage clause was noted on their main website and that I overlooked it.

FIRST OFF, when I booked my entire trip including this flight from Tokyo to Seoul, it did NOT direct me to the main website. It directed me to the ticket page only which did NOT state baggage was NOT included in ticket price. Also, there should have been mention in my actual ticket confirmation like any other functioning airline in the world.

SECONDLY, The airline was dishonest with the charge for my baggage when it came time. I was charged on my card $160 CAD for my baggage after the fact and is absolutely absurd because the counter agent wrote the total on a separate piece of paper showing the charge was supposed to be approx $29 CAD total. They wrote a totally different amount on the actual receipt and charged me a different amount in Korean Won. Another foreign couple next to me was unaware and shocked about their baggage charge at the counter too. Absolutely disgusting business practice.

I will NEVER use T WAY airline again and I hope others will take this as a warning that there is huge chance you will be conned and they bank on the fact that you will pay since you are half way across the world and about to miss your flight."
13,"arriving 2,5 hours early for our flight still wasn’t enough time to check in on time.
The staff spend most of their time running around panicking. Worst airline experience of my life."
14,Flight canceled without any prior notice. Forced us to stay in a horrible room. waited for more than 12hs.
15,i booked a flight from Seoul to Jeju Island for August. The flight was cancelled because of a typhoon! Im still waiting for a refund. Lastminute.de cant help me! and at the tway air nobody is going on the phone!? Whats wrong with this company!???
16,"Same experience as reviewer before me. I wasn't informed of the flight cancellations to Osaka and when I checked my online ticket,there was no change in the status. When I got to the airport,the staff offered to get me on a Narita flight,which I was ok with but then was later told it won't be possible after talking to their HQ. They also offered to reschedule to the 21st but that is around the time my vacation period for work ends. When we asked for a refund,the manager told me I have to message the tour company I bought the tickets from BUT thing is,I had bought them from the official Tway website and he wouldn't believe me for some reason. Not once did he even ask for my booking confirmation number! He just kind of ignored us after. I took the matter into my own hands and called their office in Korea. Thankfully they were extremely helpful even if they did not speak English. My refund will take about a week,so I had to cancel the trip altogether and pay for a hotel that I never checked into.Oh well,it is what it is. Needless to say I won't be using this airline again."
17,"Flight canceled due to airport closed after typhoon. No update, no email, no communication. I found out via airport website that only certain airlines are flying. no offer to get another flight at nearby city. NOTHING but a refund. Had to pay 5x the price of what we paid to get a same day flight! Booked through Travelocity - said Hahn Air Systems with flight operated by T'Way. No one will help! Cheap airfare if great if they are actually flying. I have never had an airline not help with getting another flight!"
18,I have flown with tway a few times now and have had issues with them every time. Today they charged me $320 for my checked bags. $16 per Kg. Total weight was 35kg. They go by their own policy not the policy of the airline you booked with. Even though I’m allowed one checked bag at 20kg they only gave me 15kg. I paid for a second though the airline but tway goes by kg only so would not honor the second bag I paid for. This is the 3rd time they have charged me for luggage I had already paid for. Then when I have explained and showed them my booking they do not care. Just say sorry and tell me I have to pay or remove weight. I will never fly tway again!
19,The English version of the website is terrible and could not complete the booking after the meal selection.
