0,I was in the unfortunate position of having to cancel flight from Daegu to Jeju as a result of my flights from Australia being suspended due to the Coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lack of demand etc. this airline refunded my fare (minus a few admin dollars) with a minimum of fuss to the payment destination I paid from. This is great service from a Korean low cost carrier who must be suffering at this time. Thank you Tâ€™way for processing this quickly for me ðŸ‘Œ
1,"In terms of cost, it was a very attractive flight. Compared to the plane that I used when I went to Hong Kong, the noise was much lower and the chair was comfortable."
2,"The typhoon I think scared every tourist with a tight deadline on the Jeju island, the airport was so busy, the friendly staff a Tway kept us calm and even with the delay communicated well and got us to our destination safely."
3,"not bad.....If the price is not cheap, I will never use it.
There's nothing to say, and there's a surcharge for baggage."
4,"Took two Tways flights, from Taipei to Seoul and Seoul to Sapporo. We did not have any problems so can't report how they handled situations- but both flights were on time and completely uneventful. Check in was quick, seats were typical. Though supposedly an LCC, the experience was indistinguishable from a flagship carrier. Ordered the in-flight lunches which is an advance purchase bundled with the modest seat selection surcharge. Hardly anyone else did but they were pretty good."
5,"I feel like smaller airlines charge for everything; however, T'Way did not. I was pleasantly surprised. My trip was short. It was only a little over"
6,"I booked a flight from SGN to NGO right after I got a Japan visa for temporary visitor. I got a really good deal though I booked only 8 hours advance the flight (around $240 with 15kg luggage). I checked in rather close to the boarding gate and my luggage was 17kg which is 2kg heavier than my kg. However, the manager of the T'way was so kind that he let me through and even granted me a cut off through a long queue. On the flight I saw beautiful flight attendants and they served me a cup of fresh water which I was really appreciated. I would definitely choose T'way again if possible."
7,Itâ€™s my first time flying this airline. Everyone I encountered were very helpful and friendly. Flight was on time and very smooth.
8,Flew on tway from jeju to gimpo. Landing was pretty smooth and seats were pretty roomy for economy. Seating was a 3-3 configuration.
9,"It was my first time flying with Tâ€™way but not my first time with a low-cost company.
Maybe itâ€™s because it was from big international airports such as Incheon, Seoul, and Chubu, Nagoya, but everything went very smoothly. From the check-in to the service onboard, it was impeccable. The plane was also very clean.
I will definitely take this company again!"
10,"Flew October from Tokyo to Seoul. Great airline, easy booking online, great checkin, modern plane. I will certainly fly with them again if in Korea. Only a 2 hour flight, but really easy. 5 star airline."
11,"I love this airline mainly because despite being the low cost airline it still offers free 20kg checked in luggage. Otherwise, our journey from Jeju to Seoul was a smooth ride. There were no delays."
12,First time using T'way Airlines and we were very pleased with the service from both check in staff and crew onboard our flight to Seoul and best thing for us we were provided exit row seats at check in so had plenty of room it was a pleasant surprise.
13,"An excellent experience from check in to on board. I say that in comparison with my experience on Jeju Air on my way into Jeju. T'way definitely beats Jeju Air hands down in terms of service and efficiency. Everything went smoothly during check in as i booked the flights online way in advance. Although it was a budget airline, the cabin crew were super friendly and served drinking water to passengers without any request as part of their routine. I was eating chocolate that i brought with me and as it melted, my hands were dirty and a steward was so observant that he came over and handed me a few serviettes to clean my hands and mouth. Can you believe a first class service on a budget airline? Had a wonderful experience and look forward to flying with T'way again! Kudos to the cabin crew of TW716 for a job well done!"
14,Flight was delayed by 40minutes. Paid slightly more expensive than their sales price but was satisfied with the service provided. Free 15kg check in baggage and they also provide water after take off.
15,"T'way is a low cost company oparating in south Korea. Tickets are pretty cheap, around 40000 won one way GMP-CJU. We were in transit from ICN to GMP and arrived earlier than planned in GMP. We asked if we could take an earlier flight to CJU and they put us on the flight leaving 15min later. An hostess when all the way from the check-in to the boarding running with us so that we could catch the plane. The plane was on time both ways. Don't expect anything but a glass of water in the plane."
16,"i took the flight from HKG to Daegu at a really reasonable price as i just booked the air ticket a week before departure in summer holiday. As a budget airline, a 15 kg free bagged luggage and 7 kg hand-carry one is offered. The seat is comfy to me. Food/drinks price is acceptable offered during flight. Flight attendants are awesome and helpful with a sweet smile! I do recommend T'way Airline to you."
17,it's a good low cost airline and it was provide free water for passengers also cheap price you get what you pay for
