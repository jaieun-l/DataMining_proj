anyway, Can't understand ppl expect full serve in short haul, you can eat at anywhere much better than the air meal, and spend ur time with ur phone or movie.."
1,"One of the great things about Jeju Air is that they are technically a budget airline but they don't skimp on anything. The ticket prices dropped recently for flights leaving Korea to Japan. I took advantage of this a couple of times. The quality of service was great and the staff was happy, friendly and helpful."
2,I took Jeju Air from Seoul (Gimpo Airport) to Jeju just want to try their airlines. Never expected is very convenient like Air Asia. Price affordable and we can choose either without baggage or with baggage (price difference subject want you choose). Price for early morning flight quite expensive compared to evening flight. I chose evening flight since its cheaper and want to save budget (hahah). I'm quite surprised during check in because i can chose any seat i want without any additional charge (first come first serve) and the staff quite helpful too. Everything good really recommended.
3,I took Jeju Air by chance so I was not expecting much. I can say I am really impressed. From booking the flight to the arrival is such a delight. Crew are very pleasant. Take off time is very quick as well. They offer very good baggage package and meal package compared to other airlines as well. I have had flown with Jeju Air twice and it the experience just kept getting better.
4,"We took Jeju Air from Guam to Osaka for vacation and looooved it!I!

Booking (tl;dr - book tickets on the APP and not online) : I have to admit, the process of buying tickets was kind of a hassle. I'm not sure if it's like this in all Jeju ticket offices, but the ones on Guam were closed when it said ""open"", and it was also hard to book tickets on the phone. It's tough to book on the website as well due to some errors and timed out connections (I tried this over 2 weeks on several computers/devices to ensure it wasn't just my browser or device and the same thing occured). BUT, it was very easy on the app. :) So I recommend you skip all these and just book straight on the app! :D

Price: We happened to get a promo deal and paid about a total of $650 USD for TWO round trip tickets from Guam - Japan. And this is not even the lowest package option; I chose one with free cancellation/more baggage/and a welcome snack. In any other airline, the price would be $1200 - $2000 USD just for that. :O

In-Person Check In: The process is very efficient and like most airline carriers so we had no hassle here :)

In-Flight Experience: On the day of our flight, the staff were SO polite and helpful and welcoming. I sprained my knee the DAY of the trip and ended up needing a wheelchair :( they took utmost care of making sure I was okay on the wheelchair, on the plane, and getting off the plane. I booked a package where cancellation was free, but it also came in with 2 checked pieces of baggage and a welcome snack. Let me tell you, those welcome snack boxes are HUGE and can fill you up just like a meal. So much that when our actual ordered meal arrived, we were already full from the snack lol. And they are delicious!! My husband and I both enjoyed the big muffins and orange juice we got going to Osaka, and the yummy tarts going from Osaka to Guam. The seats are also very comfortable, pretty roomy and the overhead bins have significantly larger room/space than most other airlines I've taken...I was shocked at how our checked luggage slid all the way to the back and there was STILL space left in the front.

I honestly have to say that the service, seating, food and everything (with the exception of the initial booking process) was actually even better than service I've received from other higher-priced airlines!! And this is a budget airline. I would SOOO take this airline again. Thank you, Jeju Air!!!"
5,"I have used to Jeju Air when I traveled to Seoul during Golden Week of this year, and booked again for December with a buddy of mine. Cheap and good service especially from Tokyo, cant wait to use their services again!"
6,"I am a frequent traveller and I never usually review airlines because for me there is a different experience on each flight whether budget or not. And I never really choose between budget or not because I care more about the time, convenience, distance and location. It was our first time to fly from Tokyo to Seoul and we have several choices and most are very expensive especially the non budget airlines but luckily we found one that's right in our budget and perfect time - Jeju Air. Departing Tokyo at 1810 at Narita's T3 we expect to arrive in Seoul at 2105. It was a full flight and our check-in took around half an hour but it was pretty smooth. The flight is not delayed and we still arrived on time. What caught my attention is their food. Since it's dinner time for us we have to eat. Checking their menu it was extensive - combination of Korean and Western options and many set meals to choose from. I found what I like - Bibimbap only this time it's vegetarian which is ok for me. At 5000 Won (5 USD) what more can I say - it was a miracle. For this price I could only buy chips in other budget airlines. The water is equally cheap - just 2000 Won for a Sparkling water. The Bibimbap is super tasty, fresh and hot off the oven. I finished each and every inch of it. The Gochujang sauce is divine, spicy, salty, sweet and savoury. This dish can easily match 5 star airlines and fine dining restaurants and will win. Hands down the best dish I ever had in any airlines I've tried. I highly recommend Jeju Air when visiting Korea you will have the best Bibimbap dish up in the air. My flight number is 7C1103 - kudos to Jeju air and its flight and crew."
7,"First time to use a budget airline going to Seoul and I am very happy with Jeju Air's service. In my case, they deserve the best budget air of South Korea. There were no delays, airplane seats are OK, flight attendants were helpful, pre-ordered food was OK, great selection of in flight food, there is inflight sales, and terminal at Seoul is same as the big airlines, so airport service was OK. I will definitely use this airline again."
8,"Great discount airline, not the cheapest but almost. Reliable, friendly people, no hassles, on time flight, straightforward process. Seems more personal than many other discount airlines. Really appreciated English speaking, polite, efficient staff. They seemed really committed to service, just like a good Big Airline. We paid extra for boarding priority and roomier seats, which is almost always a good idea for any flight over 90 minutes. Nice array of destinations, especially regional Korean places, and a generous frequent flyer program. People in the region would do well to hook up with Jeju and explore widely. Seats going from Korea to Japan and vice versa, like our itinerary, must be a particular deal because of Koreans avoiding Japan now. I"
9,From Seoul to Tokyo I actually experienced the smoothest short-haul flight ever! Compliments to the pilot!
10,"I have to say, after booking our tickets and THEN reading reviews I was extremely nervous and was prepared for the worst. Some were saying they had to pay for carryon items that were overweight and for “personal items” (because you’re only allowed 1 carryon item) and I honestly couldn’t find a good answer as to what was allowed no matter how much I googled. Upon arriving at Incheon airport we made our way to the ticket counter and were warmly greeted and got our boarding pass with not a single problem! They didn’t even weigh our backpacks and I questioned if I could take on my “personal item” for free. The answer was “Sure...no problem!” So we each boarded with 2 items...backpacks and purses! We did use the scales to make sure we were within the weight limits of the carryon item just in case. The flight left on time and arrived in Hanoi 15 minutes early with one of the smoothest landings I’ve ever experienced. And the flight attendants were absolutely precious...so friendly, helpful and kind. Thank you Jeju for a wonderful flight and all around great experience!!!!"
11,"This is the first time we flew Jeju. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We went to Seoul for Labor Day weekend. The flight out was smooth. We did have a very hard landing, so hard I wondered if we broke the landing gear. My husband is a pilot so he was not impressed with the landing. On the way back we ended up checking a bag because we bought some Korean Skin Care. There was some confusion at the check in counter, but that's to be expected when you don't speak each others' language. The flight home was smooth sailing with a perfect landing.
You can pay $15USD each way to check your luggage. I considered paying in advance for the trip home knowing that I would likely buy liquids larger than 3oz. I decided I would do it at the airport. it ended up being $45 USD per back instead of $15 USD. BUY THE CHECKED LUGGAGE WHEN BOOKING YOUR TICKET"
12,"On time flight.
Comfortable seats for average height passengers.
Staff are efficient and helpful.
They serve water although food is not included in their normal fare.
I would definitely fly again with Jeju Air!"
13,Staff was nice and helpful. Flight was smooth and short ;) we even landed little sooner. Since it was short flight there wasn't food but perso al offer some water and my seat was at exit place so there was a lot of placw for the legs ;)
14,"We flew on April 17 00:50 AM and the plane was packed. I didn't get to note much of their service, only that their flight attendants did not speak much English and mostly used gestures to communicate with non-Korean passengers. I slept well-enough on the 4 hour flight and woke up occasionally because my body felt stiff from occupying the small seat space.

The best thing about this airline is that they have a check-in counter at Seoul Station. We booked a hotel nearby and we're able to check-in our baggage +5 before our flight while we went around Seoul for a bit before taking the AREX to Incheon Airport."
15,"A cheap and reasonably priced option to fly to Seoul. We had no problem whatsoever flying from HKG to ICN and back. Both flights were smooth with little to no delays, the attendants were courteous. I would fly this airline again."
16,Booked a flight with JeJu Air because how economical the ticket was. I wasn't expecting the first class customer service. Flights arriced and departed on time or earlier. The attendants were very attentive to everyone's needs. Thank you for giving my vacation a great start and finish.
17,"Great flight, friendly people. Everything was on time and ready. I fly with two small boys and we were very happy!"
18,I love that you are allowed 10kg of handcarry luggage. They give free water and the attendants are very helpful and nice.
19,"No frills airline. Check in at Narita was a breeze while there was a line at Busan to return to Narita but it moved along at a reasonable pace. I tried to check in using the application but had no luck.
The aircraft left on time on both legs of the journey. You have to pay for extras such as seating preference, food and excess baggage. I had 15kg checked baggage included with my ticket which doesn't happen with too many airlines. carry on is a generous 10kg.
Overall I was impressed with this low-cost airline."
20,"I bought their tickets through a cheep tickets website, although I was impressed with the company’s policy’s and how nice their employees were. First of all I was able to have 15kg of check in luggage free of charge! And most importantly is that I missed my flight due to the costumes And I got a full refund!! During this period stuff helped me a lot, making conversations with the immigration officers and helping me call the airline company itself. I tottaly trust this airline and I totally recommend flying with jeju air to prevent any unwanted experiences."
21,"Jeju air floor carpet was clean. The fabric on the chair felt sturdy soft and I repeat, clean. We slept well

(The regular pricey airline that I frequently use, will be put to shame for missing their details on grime and spills)

Air hostess blended into the cream white walls. They have white uniforms with off cream jackets.

Overall, it was like a pollution free atmosphere.

Over a dozen items to order for snacks, drinks or noodles. We had cup noodles for 3000 won.

They have a full fledged duty free shopping as well."
22,"Great airline
Everything well organized including schedule
New aircraft
Flight is short and hustle free
Thier attetude as oer luggage is relatively very friendly with an understanding to international tourists that have bigger bags and to the amount of stuff you may need to carry in the cabin"
23,"First time use Jeju Air, and it was great!
The service was awesome, for me it’s the same with big airlines.
Not like some LCC, they serve water, the seats are nice, what’s more, CA are very friendly, caring. I will for sure use again if I have to use LCC.
Thank you very much!"
24,"have delicious meal on plane and good service 👍👍

I recoment Korean pork with rice, very delicious and enough for long fly (for me 5 hours)

And the crew have a good service mind if you have problem just call them"
25,"Only a short flight from seoul to juju for a few days break when I was staying in seoul.
The check in was fast and easy as I am a foreigner I had to check in at the desks but there are self check in booths for locals. But the check in was fast and efficient.
The security is quite small and fast procedure. Plane it's self was clean and well presented, the seats were cramped but quite comfy and the staff were very pleasant. Will definitely use again next time I go to jeju"
26,"Service was great, aircraft ambience was amazing, seats were comfortable, flight was punctual and no uneasiness during landing of the aircraft."
27,"The seat is quite comfortable
Clean and also tidy 🤗
The Crew is kind and also give mineral water..
From Jeju to Busan, I also flew with Jeju Air
2 thumbs up for Jeju Air
Hope will come to Jeju Island again😍"
28,"My trip to Seoul last june with Jeju Air was more than satisfying feeling that i can't help comparing them to other airlines that i ever use before.
Of course there is no one can be satisfying with having a delay glight more than 3hours without any legit reasons but all the passengers seemed to be in order and understanding without any complaints. But to my surprise, they did offer some refreshments to their passengers while waiting for the delays. I was impressed with their services. (Somebody might think that that's normal but this is the first time i get served as such considering several airlines that i already had before.)
During the boarding, it was really calm, steady and polite. The stewardess and steward were super helpful and nice. Served water every 30minutes to the passengers. Thumbs UP for them!!^^
Cheap price too if you fortunate."
29,"This is the second time I used it to fly to Seoul. I decided to go this time last minute and got a very good deal. I usually travel light, and their 10 kg hand luggage allowance suits me fine. The cheap ticket this time even included a 15 kg checked bag (although I only had hand luggage). Flights were smooth and there was a 20-minute delay of departure time on my return leg which was ok."
30,"A great short hop airline. We used as part of a longer trip in Korea so needed additional baggage allowance. We opted for the 20kg allowance, minimal increase in cost but with the benefit of 'speedy boarding' and 'bags to the door' which equated to our bags being first off the plane and onto the carousel. Compared with European budget airlines this was excellent."
31,"For being a Low Cost Carrier the planes are well kept, the crew is kind and helpful and overall a comfortable Journey. Its worth paying extra for the Window seat to have a place and sleep...as there is no entertainment on board."
32,I fly from ICB-BKK cabin are clean and staff were great in service Jeju air is LCC airline but they provide free water to any passenger it good than any LCC airline in Asia seat pitch are good I'm tall 178 cm. but i didn't fell uncomfort like any LCC airline
33,"My second time on Jeju Air and the experience was good. I chose the flight because it's less expensive and goes to where I need to go in the Pacific. Staff was very friendly and professional. I highly recommend booking your flight online as early as possible and take advantage of the seat selection...rows 15 and 16 (737 aircraft) are the emergency exits, For a little extra money, you can get these seats and provides tons of room. Other seats are cramped. In-flight meals (ordered online) were ok but not necessarily worth the extra money. I will take Jeju Air again for short flights."
34,This airline wasn’t the most expensive but with that being said it was a very well flight. I thought I would get charge for my check in bag and my carry-on however there was no fee. The flight was only two hours so there was no tv. I was offered water however but other than that the flight attendants were nice And the leg room was spacious. I made it to my destination on time. What more could you ask for in a airline company .
35,"This flight boarded early, left on time, arrived 5 mins early. The stewards were nice and attentive and the flight was smooth..

Member with them to get member exclusive discounts. Prices arent bad and if its sale season you can get really cheap prices to South Korea and also as connecting to Japan and other places."
36,"The staff speaks english, so it made checking in easier, also, since I had checked in online earlier, it made the whole process smooth. Decent legroom (I'm an average Asian in terms of height) water provided during the flight, food isn't really necessary since it was an hour flight.

Got my flight at a cheaper price since I booked earlier"
37,Very quick and smooth flight both ways. Cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. A lovely airline to fly with.
38,"I always travel on a full service airline every time I travel. Since I have to go to Korea for just for a quick holiday, I find Jeju Air to be a good example on low cost carriers. Jeju Air exceeded my expectations and it gave me a reason to fly anywhere in Asia without spending too much. Jeju Air had comfortable seats (not leather ones on other low cost carriers) which makes it more comfortable to travel. The cabin crews are really kind really are very nice. flying with them is a great experience for those flying on a low cost. Flying with them will exceed your expectations about flying with an LCC."
39,"I flew with Jeju Air from Seoul to Jeju and back, then again flying with them from Incheon back to Nagoya. I was very impressed by my first impression of them, considering it is a low-cost airline. They seemed a lot more genuine than my experience with Canada Air earlier this year even. Though they had to change an airline last minute due to aircraft conditions at Incheon, I didn't feel inconvenienced by the delay much. (but all the announcements were in Korean and Japanese, I had to ask about what was happening myself)

I ordered a sandwich pack for 9,000 won when I booked the flight, knowing it'd be too late to eat by the time I get home. (and I seemed to be the only one ordering a meal, as far as I could tell) The food was pretty good (but only came with a small cup of water). However, I'd appreciate it if they weren't so eager to collect my tray when I was still eating.

On a side note, one flight attendant handed me a Japanese customs form, assuming I'm Japanese. I was briefly confused, wondering if the form should be in Japanese. I asked the other two flight attendants later; as soon as they heard my American accent, they looked at me funny and didn't say a word, simply handed me the English forms. In my opinion, airlines should start training their staff to NOT profile passengers based on race. It's highly unprofessional.

I loved how I didn't have to pay extra for luggage and Jeju Air's warmness, compared to other airlines. I've flown with different airlines in three continents over the years (4 airlines this year alone), I'd say that Jeju Air is probably my favorite with confidence."
